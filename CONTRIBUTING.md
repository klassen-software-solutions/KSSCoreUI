# Contributing to KSSCoreUI

If you are going to contribute to this project, please make yourself familiar with our standards and
procedures:

* [Git Procedures](https://www.kss.cc/standards-git.html)
* [Swift Coding Standards](https://www.kss.cc/standards-swift.html)

Note that the iOS version is not currently included in the CI. That may change as we work on
more iOS projects, but for now the iOS version of the tests must be run manually within Xcode.
